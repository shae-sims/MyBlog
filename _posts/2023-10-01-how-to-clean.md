## Introduction

	Imagine you have started your research, and you finally finished the data collection phase. What is your next step? Datacleaning. Two words that most people who work with data dread. It can be a time-consuming process, but it is so important to the success of any research project. 

    Luckily in the world we live in we have wonderful programs that can help us to successfully clean data, it can be fast and simple! You just have to get started! One of the most common programs used for data cleaning is R, however, did you know it can be done in Python too. Due to Python being an open-source program many people have developed packages that allow for data cleaning to be done using simple commands. All you need to know is what packages are the most helpful.

    One of the most commonly used packages is called pandas, but it is not the only one. In this article, we will focus on some of the less commonly known packages that can be just as powerful. We will start by looking into Pyjanitor, a package that was made to make data cleaning as simple and as neat as possible. Then we will focus on Dedupe.
