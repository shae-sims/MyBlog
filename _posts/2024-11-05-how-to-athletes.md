## Introduction

There is so much data in sports. However, it can be hard to find and hard to get information out of it once you do find it. One of the biggest data sets out there comes from the collegiate level of competition. We will be exploring the ethics of how to get this information, how to webscrap it, and how to get some information out of it. We are looking at data on volleyball from the big 10 conference in 2023.

## Ethics of Webscrapping

Before webscrapping any website you should check the robots.txt file. This can be found on almost any website, all you have to do is type in the **url/robots.txt**. These are some examples of robots.txt files.

These files show different bots and what they are allowed to scrap and disallowed scrap by each type of bot. For the general user you need to look at the bot file indicated with an astrix (*). Along with which parts of the website the file also can have some restrictions on how often you can make requests to a website, show in the 'Crawl-delay:'. Some websites also have restrictions on the hours that you can webscrap.
